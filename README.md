# MedSegDiff: Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Model
> Revolutionizing Medical Image Segmentation with State-of-the-Art Diffusion Models in PyTorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of MedSegDiff, MedSegDiff: Medical Image Segmentation with Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The implementation has been built from scratch using the PyTorch framework.  

This repository offers a complete guide from dataset preparation to model training and evaluation, focusing on the brain tumor segmentation task in MRI images, optic cup segmentation in fundus images, and thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images.

## Introduction
DiffusionMedSeg introduces the first diffusion probabilistic model tailored for general medical image segmentation. Leveraging dynamic conditional encoding and a novel Feature Frequency Parser (FF-Parser), the model remarkably enhances segmentation accuracy in diverse medical imaging modalities.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alirezaheidari-cs/DiffusionMedSeg.git
cd DiffusionMedSeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
